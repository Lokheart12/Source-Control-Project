-I believe this is the required repository. Having this shoud help Git to ignore any files that don't need to
be tracked.

https://github.com/nfrechette/acl-ue4-plugin
-This one is interesting because of it's uses. I'm interested in making a game in Unreal Engine 5,
and one of the things that worries me is the size of the game. I want to make a great game that could
be affordable to lower income families who may have a computer with less available space. Being able  to compress
animations would go a long way towards reducing the footprint of any game I make.

https://github.com/BenPyton/ProceduralDungeon
-This one helps create procedural dungeons. If I decided to design an RPG, I can keep the replay value of a game
higher by making sure no two dungeons are the same.

-This would be fun to play, but more importantly it'd be fun to open up and see how it works. I have not
created a fully functional game yet, but reading through other peoples code and potentially even changing 
aspects of the game could be a good way to learn what to do on my own.

https://github.com/Synock/UE5Inventory
- I know this is for UE5 where the dungeon generator is for UE4, however this would still be another good tool to 
look at if I want to create an RPG. I've already got a good idea of how I would build my own inventory system (we
built a store for a project in one of my previous classes), but this could have other methods that I could implement.
